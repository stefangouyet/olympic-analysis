## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r Average Age of Medal Winners, echo=FALSE}

medal_winners <- soccer_olympics %>% filter(Medal %in% c("Gold","Silver", "Bronze"))
medal_winners$Medal <- medal_winners$Medal %>% factor(levels = c("Gold", "Silver", "Bronze"))

age_medal_winners <- medal_winners %>% 
  group_by(Team,Games,Year,Medal) %>%
  summarise(mean_age = mean(Age,na.rm = TRUE))

age_medal_winners %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year,
             y = mean_age,
             color = Medal)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()
 


age_medal_winners %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year,
             y = mean_age,
             color = Medal)) +
  geom_smooth()

```

```{r}



age_olympics <- soccer_olympics %>% 
  group_by(Team,Games,Year) %>%
  summarise(mean_age = mean(Age,na.rm = TRUE))

             y = mean_age
            )) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method="loess")+
  theme_tufte()+
   ggtitle('Mean Age of Soccer Teams at the Olympics')+ 
      theme(legend.position="none")+
        theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 22,
