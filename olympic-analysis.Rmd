## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
df <- read.csv("athlete_events.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r cumulative gold, echo=FALSE}
df1 <- df %>% group_by(NOC,Year,Season,Medal) %>% 
  count() %>%
  group_by(NOC,Medal) %>%
  arrange(Year, Season) %>%
  mutate(cs=cumsum(n))


gold_medals <- df1 %>% filter(Medal == "Gold")
#gold_medals <- gold_medals %>% group_by

gold_medals_year <- gold_medals %>% filter(Year == 2016)

gold_medals_year %>% ggplot(aes(x = NOC, y = cs)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
